# Disallow specified barrel modules when loaded by `import` (`no-restricted-barrel-imports`)

Barrel files are files that re-export the APIs of other files in the same directory, which is usually considered a bad design, refer to [vitejs/vite#8237](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237).

ESLint provides the `no-restricted-imports` rule, but full replacement existing uses is almost impossible for large projects. This rule supports replacing references to specified barrel files with their submodules.

This rule is fixable.

## Options

This rule has an object option:

- `"files"` (default `[]`) disallows specified files.
  - Unlike `paths` of `no-restricted-imports`, `files` specifies absolute paths of the module files
  - You can obtain the paths in the configuration through `require.resolve` and other methods
  - If you want to make similar effects to `patterns` of `no-restricted-imports`, you can obtain these files in the configuration through something like `fastglob.sync(patterns, { absolute: true })`

## Fail

> Suppose we have the following files
> ```js
> // /path/to/barrel-exports
> export * from './barrel-exports-deep'
> ```
> ```js
> // /path/to/barrel-exports-deep
> export const foo = 1
> ```

```js
/* eslint galaxy/no-restricted-barrel-imports: ["error", { "files": ["/path/to/barrel-exports"] }] */
import { foo } from '/path/to/barrel-exports'
```

## Pass
